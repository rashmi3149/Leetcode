Intuition
Thought of using two pointer technique to solve the question.



Approach
if there are no values in nums2;break out of loop.
if m=0;copy values from nums2 to nums1.
start comparaing values from beginning of nums1 and 2.if nums1 value<nums2 then move to next ele for nums1.
If value at nums2<nums1;then interchange.
After all comparisions,copy all leftover elements from nums2 to nums1.


Complexity

Time complexity:
O(M∗N∗Log(N))

got to know how to sort a array in javascript:
we cannot sort numeric js arrays because the values are interpreted as strings.
so we use compare method .
nums1.sort(function(a,b)=>{return a-b});
the compare function returns either negative,0 or +ve value.if -ve a should be before b.
0=equal
+ve means a should be after b.
